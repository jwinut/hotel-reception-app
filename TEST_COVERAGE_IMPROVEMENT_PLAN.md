## 🛠️ Testing Standards & Patterns

### Testing Framework Setup
- **Jest**: Test runner with built-in coverage
- **React Testing Library**: User-centric component testing
- **User Events**: Realistic user interaction simulation
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: API mocking for integration tests

### Testing Patterns
1. **AAA Pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert
2. **User-Centric**: Test from user's perspective
3. **Accessibility First**: Include a11y in all component tests
4. **Error Scenarios**: Test both happy path and error cases
5. **Async Handling**: Proper async/await patterns

### Coverage Thresholds
```json
{
  "jest": {
    "coverageThreshold": {
      "global": {
        "branches": 70,
        "functions": 70,
        "lines": 70,
        "statements": 70
      }
    }
  }
