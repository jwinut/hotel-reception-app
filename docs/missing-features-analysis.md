## Conclusion

The Hotel Reception App has a solid foundation but lacks several critical features for a complete hotel management solution. The highest priorities should be:

1. **Payment Processing** - Essential for business operations
2. **Guest Profiles** - Core to personalized service
3. **Analytics** - Critical for business decisions

With proper resource allocation, the full feature set can be implemented within 6-9 months, transforming the application into a comprehensive hotel management platform.
